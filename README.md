# Anomalous-diffusion-in-polymer-crowding
Please run the Matlab file Rh6GDiffusivityInPEO.m to simulate diffusion coefficients of Rh6G molecule and other properties in different MWs of PEO polymer solutions, but at the same concentration of the polymer

No external dataset required to demo the software/code- It's self-sufficient ready to run type demonstration

System requirements

All software dependencies and operating systems: Matlab on Windows
Versions the software has been tested on : Matlab R2014b on 64-bit
Any required non-standard hardware : None

Installation guide

Instructions:Open Matlab and run the file
Typical install time on a "normal" desktop computer: The code does not take time to install

Demo

Instructions to run on data: No data file required. Inputs are given in the code.
Expected output: Plots and values of various parameters of the Rh6G-PEO system  (see SI section S3.2 )
Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer: <1 minute

Instructions for use

How to run the software on your data: Change input parameters in 1st three sections of the code (refer to SI section S3.2 for details of parameters and algorithm)
