# Anomalous-diffusion-in-polymer-crowding
1. Please run the Matlab file Rh6GDiffusivityInPEO.m to simulate diffusion coefficients of Rh6G molecule and other properties in different MWs of PEO polymer solutions, but at the same concentration of the polymer

2. No external dataset required to demo the software/code- It's self-sufficient ready to run type demonstration

3. System requirements

All software dependencies and operating systems: Matlab on Windows

Versions the software has been tested on : Matlab R2014b on 64-bit

Any required non-standard hardware : None

4. Installation guide

Instructions:Open Matlab and run the file

Typical install time on a "normal" desktop computer: The code does not take time to install

5. Demo

Instructions to run on data: No data file required. Inputs are given in the code.

Expected output: Plots and values of various parameters of the Rh6G-PEO system  (see SI section S3.2 )

Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer: <1 minute

6. Instructions for use

How to run the software on your data: Change input parameters in 1st three sections of the code (refer to SI section S3.2 for details of parameters and algorithm). If more experimental diffusivity data is required to be plotted, please add the new molecular weight in line 27, adjust "i" according to the molecular weight (in lines 61/73/84), and finally, add the data in lines 113 & 114 to incorporate into the existing plot.
